\chapter{Hierarchical Temporal Memory}

The Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) \cite{George2009} theory was proposed by Jeff Hawkins who subsequently founded Numenta. The approach taken to develop HTM theory is different from neural networks. Neural network theories begin by developing plausible models on the underlying neuron, including the conputation being performed in them, and building up a network of neurons that is able to learn to perform required tasks. On the other hand, HTM theory leverages understanding about the neocortex (its network function and the roles of neurons and synapses in supporting this function) to design a network and the components to support the function of the network. Thus, the overall scheme in HTM is grounded in neuroscience and the resulting network must map to the structure and operation of the neocortex.
